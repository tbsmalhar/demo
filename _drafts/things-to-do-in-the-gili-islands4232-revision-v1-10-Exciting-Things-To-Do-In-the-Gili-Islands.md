<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The beautiful Gili islands are located off the north-west coast of </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lombok</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and consist of three small islands: Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air. Boasting white-powdery sand beaches and clear turquoise waters, it’s no surprise that the Gilis are one of the most popular tourist destinations in [Indonesia](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/indonesia/).</span>

Explore the islands on a bicycle, soak up the sun on one of the many incredible beaches or choose to snorkel with turtles. Enjoy the vibrant nightlife or indulge in local cuisine at the diverse selection of restaurants. There are many exciting things to do in the Gili islands.

Discover the best activities with our island checklist. **Here are ten exciting things to do in the Gili islands.**

## 1. Rent Bicycles &amp; Explore

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14643" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_14643" style="width: 800px;">![cycling gili islands](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cycling-gili-islands.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-14643">Photo by Bernard Hermant on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>Bikes can be rented from just about everywhere on any three of the Gili Islands. Since there are no motorized vehicles on the islands, bicycles are a fun and eco-friendly way to travel around. You can ride them to your favorite restaurant or beach on the other side of the island. Even better, cruise along the entire coast of the island to get a complete 360 tour!

**Bike rental starts at 60,000 IDR per day ($4)**, and are readily available throughout the island. Some hotels and airbnbs even include a bicycle free of charge in their accomodation fee.

**Warning:** be cautious when biking around the island as the trail often fades into thick sand which is near impossible to ride on, leaving you to get off and walk for parts of the way.

## 2. Visit Turtle Sanctuary On Gili Meno

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14646" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_14646" style="width: 800px;">![turtle](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/turtle-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-14646">Photo by Randall Ruiz on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>The Gili islands are often referred to as ‘the turtle capital of the world’ due to the sheer number of turtles that can be spotted here. If you’re planning a visit to the Gilis, don’t miss dropping by the privately-run turtle sanctuary on Gili Mino, which plays an important contribution to the survival of the turtles on the island.

The establishment is free to visit, but donations are accepted. All money goes towards preserving the center and feeding the turtles. Who knows, those turtles you see nearby on your snorkeling adventure might well be the turtles that were raised and released here.

## 3. Watch The Sunset

The colours differ between pink, orange or red, even when it’s cloudy the sunsets are magnificent. If you’re looking for that perfect-picture shot, [Gili Lumbung](https://business.google.com/website/gili-lumbung-bungalows-and-bar) has one of the island’s notorious sea swings, sometimes a live musician, and they serve excellent food. A great way to finish your day.
