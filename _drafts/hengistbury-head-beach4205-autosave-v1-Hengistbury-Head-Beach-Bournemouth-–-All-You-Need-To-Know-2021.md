<div>**Hengistbury Head Beach** is a south-facing beach that separates Poole and [Christchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch,_Dorset) *bay*. The beach is a sand and pebbled beach, with striking clay and ironstone cliffs. Hengistbury head is both a scenic and historic attraction that incorporates various habitats and supports a huge selection of wildlife and plants.

The beach provides plenty of panoramic views – the Heathland, Christchurch Harbour, Bournemouth Bay and the Isle of Wight.

Over one million people set foot on Hengistbury Head every year – which is a lot of footsteps on such a delicate landscape. But the combination of volunteers and rangers manage to provide a healthy balance between allowing public access and protecting the landscape and wildlife – making it an extremely special place.
