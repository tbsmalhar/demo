To make a living whilst travelling the world is a dream for many people, but what stops that dream from becoming a reality?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

*Money?*

*Responsibilities?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*

*Work?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*

*Fear?*

I am going to share with you my personal journey to how I became a digital nomad, and how it is possible to become a full time traveller and **make a living from absolutely anywhere in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>**

Yes, that’s correct, to travel the world for a living.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I’ll begin by exploring some of the most common digital nomad jobs.

## 1. Teaching Online

You will most likely find ‘Online language teacher’ at the top of any lists of ways to make money online as there is a huge demand for foreign language teachers all across the world. The job usually requires little to no experience, making it extremely popular throughout the digital nomad community.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Relatively speaking, it’s very easy to get started in becoming an online language teacher. With few qualifications needed, most people can secure a job within only a few weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Although not obligatory, I would strongly recommend becoming [TEFL qualified](https://www.tefl.org/). A TEFL certificate is a well-recognised accreditation, and I have found that the more qualified you are, the better your pay will be and the more options your have available to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Apart from qualifications, here are some of the other requirements that may be needed to become an online teacher:

- A laptop with an internet connection
- Native English Speaker
- Patience and the willingness to learn
- Previous experience as a teacher or mentor

## 2. Website Developer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

As the world is becoming increasingly more digital, the demand for web developers is also increasing. If you want to create a life on the road, then becoming a web developer is not only a good choice because it can be done remotely, but it’s also one of the highest in demand jobs and the pay is often equally just as high.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

![Web Developer Digital Nomad](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-file-300x200-1.jpg)

Working as a freelance developer is a personal favourite of mine as it is how I began my own digital nomad journey. In fact, if it wasn’t for WordPress and a ton of free YouTube tutorials I would probably be stuck doing some meaningless 9-5 job in England right now.

Here are some of the free resources that helped me when looking for web design gigs and jobs:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)
- [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/)
- [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.co.uk/)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
- [Indeed](https://www.indeed.co.uk/?r=us)
- [Guru](https://www.guru.com/?Ref=login.aspx)

## 3. Writer

Words can be found everywhere. But there needs to be people to write those words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Every book, website, leaflet, article, magazine, newspaper, advertisement, review and [Journeying The Globe](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/) blog post was wrote by some kind of writer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

![digital nomad writer](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_6346-1024x682-300x200-1.jpg)

The awesome thing about writing is that a lot of it can be done without ever needing an internet connection. That means as long as you have access to a laptop you can work from any location in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Writing jobs may involve content creation, copyrighting, blog writing and much more. On my journey I have met many writers and the reason is because it’s one of the easiest jobs to get started in as a native English speaker.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

## 4. Blogging<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Blogging is another popular job choice amongst nomads. Although it can be an easy business to start, it’s extremely difficult to master. **Blogging takes consistency, patience and the willingness to learn.**

In addition to writing the blogs, you will need to learn the various SEO techniques to optimise each of your blogs so they are visible across Google and other search engines. It’s all well having a blog, but unless you implement SEO techniques when writing your posts nobody will find them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

![blogging digital nomad](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blogging-300x180-1.jpg)

Bloggers are a unique species of entrepreneurs, **whereas most offer services or products, bloggers offer content.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>**

Blog writers most commonly make money with advertising, affiliate marketing and sponsorships. Most bloggers also sell valuable content, such as courses, eBooks, coaching and seminars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

## 5. Social Media Marketing

Every business needs Social Media Marketing these days. Marketers are paid by a client to grow their online presence through [Google](https://www.google.com/) and other social media platforms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

While it sounds simple, there can be a lot of work involved – from industry research, to organising photoshoots, to optimising keywords – there is a lot of extra work that goes into all of the colourful pictures and engaging captions that you see on social media.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

![social media marketing digital nomad](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmediatools-300x180-1.jpg)

Other marketing duties can involve scheduling posts, content creation, customer support, updating photos, running competitions and moderating social pages.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

If you are tech savvy in the sphere of marketing, this could be for you.

## 6. Affiliate Marketing

**Affiliate marketing** is simply the advertising of products and services that you trust and recommend.

If a person clicks on your unique affiliate link (which is given to you when signing up for an affiliate scheme) and then that person purchases the product, you are rewarded a commission. The customer will be charged no extra by purchasing via your link.

![affiliate marketing](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ext-300x169-1.jpeg)

*To begin as an affiliate marketer here are a few suggestions:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*

- Have your own website and start to build an email list where you can promote offers to a more specific audience
- Write articles and reviews and include your affiliate links in the posts
- Invest in paid traffic (online advertising) – this can be in any industry

If you are interested in promoting a specific product or service then contact the company directly as they might have an affiliate scheme.

Otherwise, you can sign up on affiliate networks such as [Amazon associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/), [Clickbank](https://www.clickbank.com/) and [Clicksure](http://clicksure.com/) where you will have instant access to all the links, media and promotional material you will need to get started.

## 7. Illustrator / Graphic Design

Do you already work as a Graphic Designer or Illustrator? Perhaps it’s time to take your work remote. By using online freelance platforms such as [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) to promote your previous projects, you could land some some design gigs that will mark the beginning of your **digital nomad career.**

![graphic designer nomad](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/role-graphic-designer-elearning-team-300x168-1.jpg)

From branding to social media, business marketing to logo creation – graphic design skills are becoming increasingly popular in a multitude of industries.

Every company needs well-designed graphics to make their brands and online presence stand out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
