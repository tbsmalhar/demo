**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Secret Mountain </span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">is one of Koh Phangan’s best-hidden secrets. If you’re seeking a place with breathtaking views, chilled music, and friendly and helpful staff, then this is the ideal place for you to swim, unwind, and enjoy some of arguably the most magnificent views in Koh Phangan.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Secret Mountain also hosts a highly satisfying restaurant that serves both local and European food. It’s the ideal place to visit during the evening to have a drink and enjoy some delicious food, then witness the brilliantly red and orange sunset. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the top of Secret Mountain, you can observe panoramic views covering the entire island. On a clear day, you can even see the Ang Thong Marine Park rising out of the sea. This is one of our favourite evening activities on Koh Phangan.</span>

## How to get to the Secret Mountain Koh Phangan

The Secret Mountain is located hidden away, on the top of an extremely steep hill, directly behind the town of Baan Tai. It can be difficult to find so we have attached a map below:
