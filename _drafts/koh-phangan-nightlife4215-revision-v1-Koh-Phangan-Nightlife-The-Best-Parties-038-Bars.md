<div>[Koh Phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/koh-phangan-guide/) is most commonly known for its famous Full Moon Parties. The first full moon party was arranged by a small group of hippies back in 1985. However, now, the island attracts more than 10,000 visitors each month. The huge growth in tourism has resulted in the development of a wide range of bars, nightclubs, and restaurants.

If you’re coming to Koh Phangan solely for the nightlife, then make sure to stay at [Haad Rin](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g303907-d556707-Reviews-Haad_Rin-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html). Haad Rin hosts the largest selection of bars and nightclubs on the island.

There is more than just the full moon parties at Haad Rin. The area is what you would describe as ‘energetic’ and the go-to-place for cheap booze, lively atmosphere, and late-night partying.

We will be discussing all you need to know about the *nightlife in Koh Phangan*, and everything you can do during the *nights in Koh Phangan*.

## Best Parties in Koh Phangan (Besides Full Moon Party)

Besides the full moon party, Koh Phangan has a bunch of other large festivals that take place throughout the island. If you are a party enthusiast, then here are some other parties to consider checking out on your nightly adventures.

### Waterfall Party

The Waterfall Party takes place each month, every two days before and after a full moon party. Located in the deep jungle of Ban Tai, the waterfall party is a night you certainly won’t forget. Surrounded by waterfalls, incredible rock formations, and thick jungle, this outdoor dance club provides an entirely unique party experience.

The music ranges from Techno House to Electro and hosts some of the best international and local DJ’s the planet has to offer. Although there aren’t nearly as many partygoers as the full moon party, some people consider the waterfall party to be an overall better nightlife experience.

What better way to finish the evening than enjoying a beautiful sunset? There are many places to watch the sunset, but we found one of the best places was the [Amsterdam Bar.](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g303907-d2000635-Reviews-Amsterdam_Bar-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html) You can grab yourself a sweet cocktail to sip on, whilst enjoying the breathtaking-sunset displaying colors in the sky that don’t usually belong.

An obvious choice, but why not take a stroll along the beach? Koh Phangan is home to some of the most stunning beaches in all of Thailand – and guess what? They can be just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) at night time.

Peer up at the gleaming stars, you may even see a shooting star. You will see people wandering in the shallows, looking for crabs and other sea-creatures to cook for dinner.

### Dining at a new restaurant

![milky bay resort](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/milky-bay-food-on-beach-300x168-1.jpg)

Try checking out a new restaurant that you haven’t been to yet. Luckily, there are many restaurants on the island to help satisfy your appetite.

A personal favorite of ours is [Milky Bay Resort.](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g303907-d636809-Reviews-Milky_Bay_Resort-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html) The prices are affordable and the service is second to none. They have an excellent choice of grill food available, such as fresh fish, meat, sausages, and vegetables. We strongly recommend this place if you’re looking for a good, on the beach, dining experience.
