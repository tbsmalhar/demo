<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first thing to note about the rain in Koh Phangan is that because of where the island is situated, the rain is a kind of warm and tropical rain – and not necessarily unpleasant.

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are numerous Coffee shops on the island, and they make the perfect haven for an afternoon read. Unlike western coffee shops, every coffee has the additional option to be served iced. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chill out on the sofas while the air con showers you with fresh air. [Doppio Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303907-d8325151-Reviews-Doppio_Cafe-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html), located in Thong Sala, is a personal favourite of ours.</span>
