The prices are affordable and the service is second to none. They have an excellent choice of grill food available, such as fresh fish, meat, sausages, and vegetables. We can only recommend this place if looking for a good, on the beach, dining experience.

In addition to the plethora of food options, there’s a large selection of drinks on the menu, too. The Watermelon shakes are a personal favourite of ours and a great way to start your day.

[SOHO Bar &amp; Grill](https://sohophangan.com/) is a great remedy for curing those morning hangovers. If you’re a lover of Ribs, then you will certainly love this restaurant. The English owner is very friendly and chatty and will make you feel completely at home.

A greasy full English breakfast for only 150 Baht, what’s not to love? The staff are extremely friendly and always seem to be smiling. We haven’t tried the brunch, but if the breakfast is anything to go by, then we are sure you will not be left disappointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
