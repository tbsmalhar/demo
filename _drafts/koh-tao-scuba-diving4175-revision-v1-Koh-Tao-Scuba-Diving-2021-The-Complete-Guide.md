<div>Koh Tao (which means ‘Turtle Island’ in English) is a scuba diving paradise. The islands beauty stretches both above and below the water, with its magnificent stunning reefs and abundance of marine life.

Koh Tao is an ultimate divers wonderland, laced with white sandy beaches, and a lush terrain of emerald palm trees spanning across 21 square kilometres.

We are going to cover everything you need to know about Scuba Diving in Koh Tao.

## Is Koh Tao Worth Visiting?

Despite being smaller than her neighbour islands, what Koh Tao lacks in size, she certainly makes up for in beauty. The island’s weather remains consistent throughout the year, reaching temperatures of up to 35 degrees.

As the island situates in the gulf of Thailand, the island remains reasonably sheltered. This protection allows for the waters to stay calm and keeps the visibility clear, thus resulting in the idyllic location for newbie divers.

Whale sharks, shark rays, turtles, dolphins, and seahorses are just some of the marine life you can expect to spot on your underwater adventures. However, some species only appear in certain months, making September the most optimal month for sightseeing.

## Is Koh Tao Good For Diving?

To ask the question ‘Is Koh Tao Good For Diving’ would be like asking if the north pole is still cold. Ok, maybe that wasn’t the best analogy. But, yes, Koh Tao is excellent for diving!

Renowned for its dive culture, Koh Tao is considered the capital of scuba diving in Thailand. The two most popular diving bodies to become accredited are PADI (The Professional Association of Diving Instructors) and SSI (Scuba School International).

There is a selection of dive courses that cater to all experience levels. Whether you’re new to diving and consider yourself a beginner, or you are a more experienced diver looking to take your skills to the next level, we have compiled a list of classes to choose from:

### Half-Day Discover Scuba Diving Course

This course was created for prospecting divers looking to get a taste for the underwater world and diving. The half-day session is a supervised underwater tour where you will learn how to operate the dive equipment and where you can reach depths of 12m.

### Open Water Course

If you’re looking to take your first steps into diving, the open water course is the initial training for any novice diver. On this course, you can expect a mixture of practical and classroom-based learning. Included is a total of four dives in shallow waters with depths of up to 18m.

This course is four days long and always completed in a safe area such as a bay or swimming pool, so even divers as young as ten years old can participate.

### Advanced Open Water Course

Commonly seen as a course for competent divers who are looking to proceed to an expert level; the advanced open water course will test you both physically and mentally with depths up to 30m. In this course, you can expect up to five dives. Divers 12 years old upwards can enrol.

### Rescue &amp; EFR Courses

Before taking this course, you must first collect certificates in first aid and CPR. The course has been designed with an end goal to make divers equipped with the skills to save and help others in an emergency.

If you lack the medical qualifications, then an extension course can be combined to make sure you get your CPR, AED, and primary / secondary care qualifications. This extensive course is known as Emergency First Response (EFR). Divers as young as 12 years old can participate in the Rescue and EFR courses.

## Professional Diving In Koh Tao

![scuba diving koh tao](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scuba-diving-koh-tao-300x174-1.jpg)

### Divemaster Course

Often the first step to becoming a professional diver. The divemaster course is roughly a 4-6 week program which requires you to be at least 18 years old and have a minimum of 40 dives under your belt.

Additional requirements include completing your PADI advanced open water dive course, EFR primary and secondary care training, and to be given the go-ahead by a medical professional.

### PADI Instructor Development Course (IDC)

The IDC is a two-week course, designed for individuals who are looking to become teachers. Like the divemaster, there are specific requirements to enrol onto the course.

Naturally, the requirements are a little more specific as it is a specialist course.

To participate, you must be at least 18 years old and have completed a minimum of 60 logged dives in varying circumstances: night diving, deep diving, and underwater navigation. You also need to have been a certified diver for at least six months and be an accredited divemaster with the EFR certificates, too.

### PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer Course (MSDT)

[The Master Scuba Diver Trainer Course](https://www.padi.com/courses/master-scuba-diver-trainer) (MSDT) is one of the best dive courses you can take to improve your diving abilities.

To partake in a MSDT course, you must be at least 18 years of age and have completed a minimum of 100 logged dives. Other requirements include being a certified diver (for a minimum of 6 months) and possessing the appropriate EFR qualifications.

## Scuba Diving Courses For Children

Intended for children as little as 8-years-old, the PADI bubble maker and PADI seal team will give your children experience in the underwater world from an early age.

### PADI Bubble Maker

Conducted in a safe environment, the [PADI Bubble Maker](https://www.padi.com/courses/bubblemaker) is only ever exercised in depths of two to four meters, such as a swimming pool or one of the shallower dive sites. Bubble Maker is the child equivalent of the Discover Scuba Diving course and targets youngsters with zero experience.
