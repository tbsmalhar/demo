<div>Koh Phangan is a small island situated in Southeast Thailand which is renowned for its white-sand beaches and picturesque views.

There are many breathtaking viewpoints around the island; not all are easy to find, so we have compiled a list of the most impressive viewpoints in Koh Phangan.

The most desirable times to get a great photo, of course, is just as the sun starts to set as you can catch some incredible shots of the sunset. In photography, this is referred to as ‘the golden hour’.

## Three Sixty Bar

![360 bar koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/360-bar-koh-phangan-300x169-1.jpg)

The Three Sixty Bar, commonly abbreviated to its numbers ‘360 bar’, is a bamboo bar and restaurant that’s sat up in the northern mountains of the island. The bar boasts impressive panoramic views of the North-East quarter of the island.

From the bar, you can see Koh Phangan’s beautiful baby sister island Koh Ma and the spit that connects the two. The bar is known for its groovy electronic music and chilled out vibes.

The bar has three different levels, but on the entry-level, you will find the main bar. From the bar, you can treat yourself to a variety of fruit shakes, cocktails, branded beers, and alcopops.

![360 bar views](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/360-bar-300x225-1.jpg)

The 360 bar has a selection of Thai cuisine and Western favourites. With seating, there are plenty of tables available with scenic views of the entire island. There is a strictly no-shoes rule on the decking, so please make sure to abide by the rules to avoid a telling off.

The bar is free to enter; however, they do prefer for you to purchase something – even if it’s only a drink. The food and drinks are reasonably priced, and you can expect to pay about 120 baht for a traditional Thai dish.

**Where is the 360 Bar Koh Phangan?**

You will find the 360 bar on the North-East side of Koh Phangan. The easiest way to find it is by looking out for ‘[Utopia Resort](http://www.phanganutopiaresort.com/)‘, then follow the signs from there to 360.

<div class="GDRHkb r-iRbs2VF3uOIM"></div></div></div></div></div></div>**How to get to the 360 Bar Koh Phangan**

As the 360 bar is in the middle of nowhere, walking is not an option. Taxi is one of the most popular ways to get to the viewpoint, mainly because the path leading upwards to 360 is extremely rocky. It is even possible to reach the bar by scooter, but ride with caution as the roads are unpaved and bumpy.

**Best times to visit**

![sunset 360 bar koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sunset-981255_1280-300x199-1.jpg)

As you can probably imagine, during sunset is an ideal time to visit the 360 bar. Although equally breathtaking in the day time, nothing beats watching the radiant orange sun, set over the distant island of Ko Ma.

## Khao Ra Mountain

![Khao Ra Mountain Koh Phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Khao-Ra-Koh-Phangan-Suratthani-Thailand-001-nekcycntisk30nqyp1da1i6wlx3sfdpftvw8sqgwku-300x200-1.jpg)

Khao Ra Mountain is an astonishing, beautiful central viewpoint on Koh Phangan. The angle stands 635 meters above sea level, offering panoramic views of the island. Being the highest viewpoint on the island, you are guaranteed a magical experience.

**Where is it Khao Ra Mountain Phangan?**

Khao Ra sits in the North region of the island.

**How to get to Khao Ra Mountain Koh Phangan**

We suggest putting on your walking shoes as the only way to reach the viewpoint is on foot. It is a long walk, so we recommend trainers or hiking boots, and of course taking plenty of water.

A large proportion of the walk is through the jungle, so we recommend covering up in light clothing to deter the mosquitoes.

**Best times to visit**

We recommend setting off early for the hike, as the walk takes roughly two hours to complete. The views are at their greatest mid-day when the sun is prime. The trek can be very slippery and therefore dangerous, so make sure to visit on a dry day.

## Amsterdam Bar

![amsterdam bar koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amsterdam-bar-koh-phangan-300x198-1.jpg)

[The Amsterdam Bar](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303907-d2000635-Reviews-Amsterdam_Bar-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html) is a social hot spot for backpackers. The bar has a Jamaican theme and plays regular reggae music. There are two levels, both with excellent views that stretch for miles.

Amsterdam Bar is the idyllic place for lounging around in the sun or daydreaming into the sunset. On the main floor, there is a shallow pool which you can dip your toes into while enjoying a cocktail or drink of your pleasing.

Around the pool, you will find different patterned cushions, mats, and lounge pillows to lie back and unwind on.

**Where is Amsterdam Bar Koh Phangan?**

Located near Thong Sala, the bar is straightforward to find as it’s next to a lot of the local resorts.

The large rocks can identify the path to the bar, with “The Amsterdam Bar” branded in huge letters on the side.

You should follow the vertical path upwards until you see the stairs to the entrance. The bar has two parking areas, one central car park and, one used for overflow parking.

**How to get to Amsterdam Bar Koh Phangan**

Taxis, scooter, and walking are all viable ways to reach the bar. Walking will be the cheapest, but make sure to wear suitable footwear as the ascent upwards is very steep.

**Best times to visit**

Being one of the islands hotspots for sunsets, we recommend arriving at around 5 pm, just in time for a beautiful orange sunset where you will see colours in the sky that don’t usually belong.

## Apichada Viewpoint Bar

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1404" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1404" style="width: 699px">![ban tai views](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P0940094-300x193-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1404">Enjoying the views of Ban Tai</figcaption></figure>Apichada Viewpoint Bar is a newly established bar that’s replaced the original viewpoint in Ban Tai.

You will find decking around the edge of the bar, with Cushions and low-level tables for maximum comfort. The laid-back atmosphere is very apparent, with calm music and serene sunsets that leave you in awe as the sky transforms from bright blue to burnt orange.

**How to get to Apichada Viewpoint Bar Koh Phangan**

Scooter is our chosen method of transportation. But, similarly to the other viewpoints, the path up to the top is often underestimated and should be approached with caution.

*<span class="w8qArf">Address: </span><span class="LrzXr">Ban Tai, Ko Pha-ngan District, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand</span>*

**Best times to visit**

The evenings tend to be the most popular time to visit, as the sunsets are particularly remarkable from this side of Koh Phangan. The Apichada viewpoint is suitable for families, couples, and groups.

## Domsila Viewpoint

![domsila viewpoint](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/domsila-viewpoint-300x164-1.jpg)

Domsila Viewpoint can be found in the centre of Koh Phangan, located at the top of Phaeng Waterfall. On the summit, you will find a panoramic of the entire island, and you can even see the neighbour island Koh Samui.

**How to get to Domsila Viewpoint Koh Phangan**

To get to Domsila viewpoint you will need to first head to [Phaeng Waterfall](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g303907-d13340382-Reviews-Phaeng_Waterfall-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html). The viewpoint is a short 15-minute walk from bottom to top. Remember to wear appropriate shoes and to bring water.

*<span class="w8qArf">Address: </span><span class="LrzXr">Ko Pha-ngan Sub-district, Ko Pha-ngan District, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand</span>*
