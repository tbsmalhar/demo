<div>Koh Samui, situated in the Gulf of Thailand, is most famous for its picturesque beaches, crystal clear waters, and warm weather. But, there are still plenty of things to do in Koh Samui when it rains.Whether it’s the monsoon season or just a wet and rainy day, we are going to share with you our favourite activities on Koh Samui for those not so sunny days.

## 9 Exciting Things To Do In Koh Samui When It Rains

### Have a Thai Massage

![koh samui massage](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-samui-massage-300x225-1.jpg)

There’s no better way to spend a rainy day than getting a traditional Thai massage. Massages come in all shapes and sizes, but as you’re in Thailand, a traditional Thai massage is usually a safe bet.

You’ll find plenty of massage parlors across the island, often with young girls outside trying to attract your business. Massages start from as little as 200 baht for a one-hour Thai massage.

Despite common belief, most massages do not come with a happy ending. (unless you manage to find a seedy backstreet parlor of course)

### Take a stroll along the beach

![koh samui beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-samui-beach-300x169-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The beaches are still beautiful, the air is still fresh, and it’s still warm. Our favourite beaches on Koh Samui are Lawai Beach, Bophut Beach, Lipa Noi Beach, and Silver Beach.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The most glorious thing about South East Asia is that it’s vastly different from back home – where the rain is an unpleasant experience. In Thailand, the rain can be refreshing and, even if you do get drenched, you will usually dry extremely fast.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rain or shine, the beaches are continuously stunning. </span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Take a Thai cooking class</span>

![Thai cooking class](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silom-thai-cooking-school-2-300x198-1.jpg)

Spend your day productively by learning a new skill. A Thai cooking class will equip you with all the skills you need to prepare a delicious Thai dish.

Bring a skill back home that you can share with your family and friends. As everyone loves food, your time definitely won’t be wasted.

[InFusion cooking classes](https://www.infusioncookingclassessamui.com/) are one of the most popular on Koh Samui, located in the north of the island. Prices start from 990 baht and go all the way up to 7000 baht for private lessons. There are cheaper schools to choose from, but we found the service, quality, and training at InFusion second to none.

### Watch a film at Cineplex Cinema

![cineplex koh samui](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cineplex-300x166-1.jpg)

Sometimes a few home comforts can be the perfect remedy for a rainy day. Located in Tesco Lotus, just outside Chaweng is the [Cineplex cinema.](https://www.majorcineplex.com/cinema/major-samui)

Most of the films are featured in English and provide Thai subtitles. There are three screens playing movies throughout the day, and the cinema usually closes at around 11:30 pm.

The cinema rooms are very comfortable, with reclinable seats and seat selection available. Snacks and drinks are available for purchase in the ticket area before the film begins.

*Please note, in Thailand, every film starts with a blessing to the king. It is respectful to stand up at this point, just as you will see others do.*

### Fire guns at the shooting range

![koh samui shooting range](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-samui-shooting-range-300x200-1.jpg)

Blow off some steam by shooting a pool of high-powered weaponry at a static target. Koh Samui Shooting Range is the perfect activity for those rainy days on the island.

Koh Samui Shooting Range boasts a great selection of guns to choose from. From rifles to revolvers, you will be equipt with everything you need to present an enjoyable day out.

The cost is priced based on the number of bullets you fire, with some of the larger bullets costing insignificantly more.

Generally, shooting tends to be an expensive activity but, it’s still a lot less than what you would pay in western countries.

### Take a Yoga Class

![Muay Thai Fight Thailand Koh Samui](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Muay-Thai-Fight-Thailand-Koh-Samui-300x200-1.jpg)

Muay Thai, the most famous sport in Thailand, has a long history in the country dating back to several hundreds of years ago. Commonly referred to as ‘The Art Of Eight Limbs’; Muay Thai is a close-combat martial arts that utilizes the entire body.

Live Muay Thai fights can be found everywhere in Koh Samui and the rest of Thailand. The fights are fast-paced, and the atmosphere is always lively – proving a popular activity for those rainy days.

Central Festival Samui is the only indoor shopping centre on the island. This modern and popular shopping mall boasts a variety of restaurants, bars, and retail shops.

Located in Chaweng, this shopping complex provides an impressive experience of shopping on a world-class beach destination. Central Festival is not only exciting, but it provides the ideal day out for a rainy day.

### Get a Bamboo Tattoo

![bamboo tattoo](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bamboo-tattoo-300x225-1.jpg)

Bamboo tattoos are an ancient part of Thai history, originating from the monks performing Sak Yant tattoos as seen on some muay thai fighters.

Thankfully, you won’t have any problem finding a tattoo parlour as there are plenty of options to choose from throughout the island.

We advise looking for an artist with good reviews to ensure the correct hygiene and safety standards.
