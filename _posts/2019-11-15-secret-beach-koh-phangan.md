<div><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite what the name suggests, Secret Beach isn’t really so secret anymore. But it’s hard to keep such a beautiful paradise hidden. Secret Beach is located on the North-West face of Koh Phangan, in the area of Haad Son. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Beach has a well-earned reputation for white sands and crystal clear waters. It’s the ideal place to relax and escape the chaotic outside world. The beach also goes by the name of ‘Haad Son beach’, which is what you should search for on a map if you are following directions.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">We have compiled this in-depth guide on everything you need to know about Secret Beach for those who are planning a visit to Koh Phangan.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to get to Secret Beach Koh Phangan</span>

![how to get to secret beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-get-to-secret-beach-300x200-1.jpg)

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYQsTYwA9-o" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Below are the most common ways to reach Secret Beach:</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scooter</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most popular ways to travel to Secret Beach is by scooter. There are many rental shops where you can hire Scooters from near [Thong Sala](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/thong-sala-night-market-koh-phangan/ "Thong Sala Night Market in Koh Phangan") Pier. However, it’s likely your resort will have Scooters and Motorbikes available for hire.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The usual price on the island for Scooter rental is roughly 250 baht per day, but you may be able to negotiate for a better deal.</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxi</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you don’t feel comfortable driving a Scooter then there are plenty of taxis around to take you to and from the beach. The rate for the taxi will of course vary depending on where you are staying. At the entrance to Secret Beach, you will find a few taxis lurking nearby so you don’t need to panic about being stranded there once you have finished your visit.</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Walk</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cheapest and most rewarding way to get to Secret Beach is to take the old fashioned way and walk. If you are staying in [Haad Yao](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/haad-yao-beach-koh-phangan/ "Haad Yao Beach Koh Phangan"), then the walk shouldn’t take any longer than 20 minutes.</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cycle</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">An alternative to a scooter hire would be a bicycle hire. Bicycles are available to hire throughout the island and in our opinion a little bit safer.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Where to grab Food and Drink on Secret Beach?</span>

![Koh Raham secret beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-2-300x158-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Secret Beach, there is only one main bar/restaurant. However, if you venture over to the right side of the beach you will find [Koh Raham](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303907-d10110931-Reviews-Koh_Raham_Restaurant_and_Beach_Bar-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html) which is the closest resort and has a restaurant overlooking the bay of the beach. There is a large selection of food to choose from, including traditional Thai cuisine and western favorites.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Things to do at Secret Beach</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Get a massage</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enjoy a massage at ‘Su Massage’; an open bamboo hut that is surrounded by the soothing sound of the waves. A Thai massage isn’t the only option available, you can also indulge in an oil, shoulder, and back and head massage at a very reasonable cost.</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Go for a swim</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">It might be the most obvious option, but you can’t visit Secret beach without swimming in her warm waters. The water is clear enough to comfortably swim with peace of mind that nothing is lurking underneath you.</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Snorkeling</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Like most places on the island, snorkeling is a very popular activity. There is a very attractive snorkeling spot on the right-hand side of the beach where you can see a wide variety of different fishes.</span>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VY0DNclknRE" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Have a photoshoot</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is an abundance of swings and decorative seats to get that picture-perfect photo for your social media. The beach also boasts picturesque tropical backdrops, including rockery, tall palm trees, and colourful flowers. </span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Watch the sunset or sunrise</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of our favourite activities is watching the sunset from Secret Beach. Don’t worry, for all of you early risers the sunrise is equally as beautiful.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">We recommend to bring a rug and find a spot on the beach while enjoying a drink from the bar.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who is Secret Beach suitable for?</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Secret Beach is quiet and small, making it a perfect destination for families and those with young children.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is also an idyllic place for loved up couples, with a very chilled out vibe. Secret Beach is the opposite of a party beach, so if you’re in a large group looking for something lively then Secret Beach probably won’t be the beach for you.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">What to wear on the beach</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">We have included this section in our guide as there are a few signs with restrictions on [dress code](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/dress-code-for-thailand-temples/ "Dress Code For Thailand Temples: Do’s And Don’t") when entering the beach. Koh Phangan has a large hippy culture, but on this particular beach, they do ask for females to wear a bikini top if they are going to wear swimwear.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accommodation</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is possible to stay on Secret Beach, although there are only two options to choose from.</span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Secret Beach Bungalows</span>

![secret beach bungalows](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/secret-beach-bungalows-300x200-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">[Secret Beach Bungalows](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/secret-beach-bungalows.html?aid=2136884&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2) is the cheaper option of the two and is literally steps away from the beach. Rooms start from as little as £20 per night and all rooms are inclusive of WiFi, air conditioning and private bathrooms. </span>

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Haad Son Resort (Koh Raham)</span>

![haad son resort](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/haad-son-resort-300x199-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">[Haad Son Resort](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/haad-son-resort.en.html?aid=2136884&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2) is a 3-star hotel located on the edge of Secret Beach. All of the rooms are modern and furnished, with prices starting from under £30. If you’re looking for something fancier, they also have a selection of villas starting from £60. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The resort features a swimming pool, restaurant, and a variety of traditional Thai massages. </span>
