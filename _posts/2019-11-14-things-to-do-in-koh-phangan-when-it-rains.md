<div><span data-preserver-spaces="true">[Koh Phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/koh-phangan-guide/) can be heaps of fun, especially when the radiant orange sun pours over the famous beaches and terrains of tropical hills. However, when the occasional rain does hit, many are left twiddling their thumbs. That is why we have compiled a list of 9 things to do in Koh Phangan when it rains.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first thing to note about the rain in Koh Phangan is that because of where the island is situated, the rain is a kind of warm and tropical rain – and not necessarily unpleasant. With that said, your book will definitely still get soggy. This leads us to our first suggestion…</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indulging In a Good Book In The Local Coffee Shops</span>

![Indulging In a Good Book In The Local Coffee Shops](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19145764_1860072710981228_4849697772502309647_n-300x169-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are numerous Coffee shops on the island, and they make the perfect haven for an afternoon read. Unlike western coffee shops, every coffee has the additional option to be served iced. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chill out on the sofas while the air con showers you with fresh air. [Doppio Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303907-d8325151-Reviews-Doppio_Cafe-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html), located in Thong Sala, is a personal favourite of ours.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meditation And Yoga Classes</span>

![meditation koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1000_1509962928-300x200-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Haad Yao is an area you will soon become very familiar with if you’re seeking a slower way of life. Once you have visited some of the yoga classes, you’ll be ready to boast your new moves on the beach when the rain clears.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some of the top Yoga Retreats/Schools on the island are Orion Healing Center, Agama Yoga, Ananda yoga and The Sanctuary. </span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Challenge Koh Phangan</span>

![the challenge koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hero_slide_3_1024x1024-300x200-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If sitting inside waiting for the rain to stop is too dull, the challenge Koh Phangan is open seven days a week to fulfil all your total wipeout fantasies. The water obstacle course was inspired by the famous TV show but has its own unique twist.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">For 500 baht you can have unlimited play on the course but if you do want to take it more seriously then you can be timed and try to secure a top place on the leaderboard- which would be even more impressive in the rain!</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Take A Visit To Pure Relax Spa</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prices are a little higher than the surrounding massage parlors but the quality is also better. Prices range from 300 baht to 1500 baht and cater to all needs with their large selection of treatments. To name a few, they offer Swedish, hot stone, oil, traditional Thai and Bali massages, but the list really does go on. You can find an extensive list on their </span>[<span data-preserver-spaces="true">official website</span>](http://purerelaxspa.com/koh-phangan-massage/)<span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span>

![Koh Phangan shopping](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Moon-Bazaar-02-1024x716-300x210-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are plenty of local shops on the island to escape the rain. Typically, the shops sell all sorts; from genie pants to Buddhist inspired jewellery. You will find that most shops sell the same products, so we advise shopping around before purchasing. Unlike the markets, in the actual shops, you will be lucky to get a discount as the prices are usually non-negotiable.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Get A Tattoo</span>

![Koh Phangan tattoo ](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Khmer-art-1-300x201-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you’re looking for a more permanent souvenir to take back home, there is an abundance of tattoo parlors to choose from. Our recommendation would be to go on trip advisor and read the reviews to find one that best suits you as each parlour offers a different style of artwork. Ink Point Tattoo, Southern Ink Tattoo, Tiki Tattoo are some of the top-rated parlours.</span>
