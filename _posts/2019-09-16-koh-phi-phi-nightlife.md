<div>[Koh Phi Phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Phi_Islands) has gained a worldwide reputation for being a party-paradise, and it’s not undeserving. All-night partying til the morning is the norm on Koh Phi Phi, making it a popular travel destination for party enthusiasts.

The nightlife on Koh Phi Phi is unique and very different from other party hotspots in Thailand. The scene is youthful and vibrant, close-packed, energetic and – unlike other parts of Thailand – it is not sleazy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

A cheap bucket of alcohol is the preferred drink choice on the island, and they are sold everywhere. The buckets can be filled with almost anything you want, but common ingredients include M150 (the Thai equivalent to Red Bull), Soda, Ice and a 300ml bottle of alcohol.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The buckets start from as little as 200 baht, making it cheap and convenient to share drinks with your friends.

*After experiencing Koh Phi Phi Nightlife, you will realise there is no other place like it in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*

## Is Koh Phi Phi a party island?

**We definitely consider Koh Phi Phi a party island.** Although during the day the island can be somewhat tame, once the sun goes down the small island transforms into one vibrant party scene.

From nightclubs to beach bars; if you love to party then Koh Phi Phi is the place to come.

## Things to do in Koh Phi Phi besides partying

Koh Phi Phi has a reputation for being a party island, but the island has loads more to offer than cheap liquor. Your trip to Koh Phi doesn’t need to be all about drinking till you’ve passed out or can’t remember anything the next day.

The island is rich with plenty of exciting things to do; and besides, the island is too beautiful to miss the chance of really exploring it.

We are going to list some things you can do in Koh Phi Phi besides partying that will make your trip more fulfilling and memorable:

### Check out Koh Phi Phi Viewpoint

![Koh-Phi-Phi-Viewpoint](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koh-Phi-Phi-Viewpoint-300x199-1.jpg)

Trekking to the top of Koh Phi Phi is not the faint-hearted. You will be tired, and you will be extremely hot. It takes around 20 – 30 minutes to reach the peak, but the panoramic view at the top makes it well worth the struggle. Words just simply don’t describe how spectacular the views are from the here.

### Kayaking Around Koh Phi Phi

![koh phi phi kayaking](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-phi-phi-kayaking-300x142-1.jpg)

Kayaking is a popular activity on the island with prices starting as little as 100 baht per hour. You can explore some of the nearby caves, which are often unreachable by land.

Kayak rental shops can be found across the island and prices are usually negotiable if you haggle hard. [Monkey Beach](http://www.phiphi.phuket.com/attractions/monkey-beach.htm) tends to be people’s first stop, although the area is often heavily populated with tourists and tour boats.

### Deep-Sea Fishing

![koh phi phi fishing](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-phi-phi-fishing-300x169-1.jpg)

Deep-sea fishing is a slightly more expensive activity that you can experience off the island of Koh Phi Phi. From complete beginners to master anglers, the crystal-clear waters of Koh Phi Phi are swarming with a large selection of fish.

### Phi Phi Cooking Class

![pums cooking school phi phi](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pums-cooking-school-phi-phi-300x198-1.jpg)

If you want to learn how to cook traditional Thai dishes, then why not take a cooking class? This is your chance to learn about all the different ingredients and techniques that make delicious Thai cuisine.

[Pum’s Cooking School](https://th.pumthaifoodchain.com/cookingschool.html) is a popular option, located in the heart of everything (next to the pier). You’ll learn hidden trade secrets which you can take back and impress your friends back home.

## How long should you spend in Koh Phi Phi?

For the most part, Koh Phi Phi is only visited as a day trip from one of the neighboring islands. As a nomad, we understand that you may require more time to explore and dive deeper into the island.

*Which begs the question, how long should you spend on Koh Phi Phi?*

Depending on your itinerary, we recommend staying on the island for a maximum of 4 days. That should allow for enough time to visit the main attractions, and also uncover some of the island’s hidden gems.
