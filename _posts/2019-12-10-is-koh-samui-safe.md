<div><span data-preserver-spaces="true">[Koh Samui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Samui) (Samui Island) is a famous island situating in the Gulf</span>*<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span>*<span data-preserver-spaces="true">of Thailand, attracting backpackers staying for a week or two in traditional beach bungalows, to wealthy holiday-goers staying for a weekend in one of the most lavish resorts or villas on the island.</span>

But safety in Koh Samui can be a concern – the risk of scams, traffic accidents, and creepy crawlies is undoubtedly real. If you add drunken holidaymakers into the mix, you could be asking yourself, “is Koh Samui safe?”.

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">That is why we have written this guide – to arm you with all the information required for </span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">staying safe in Koh Samui.</span>**

In this article, we will be talking about a range of topics: from the risks of being scammed, to whether it’s safe for a solo female traveller in Koh Samui – and just about everything in-between. We’ll be discussing Koh Samui in its totality.

Perhaps you’re a lone female traveller who is worried about her safety and the idea of travelling alone, or maybe you’re just questioning if Koh Samui is a family-friendly place. No matter your concern, we have created this guide to answer all of your questions.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Is_Lombok_Safe_Our_Take">Is Koh Samui Safe? (Our Take)</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the whole, </span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Koh Samui is perfectly safe. </span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Respectfully, there is an element of risk (just like with any destination in the world) – but typically speaking, Koh Samui is undoubtedly a safe place to travel. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Situated in the Gulf of Thailand is Thailand’s second-largest island, Koh Samui. If you’re planning a trip to Thailand, then you can’t miss seeing this majestic Thai island.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Koh Samui is known for its idyllic beaches, stunning landscape, and friendly locals, making it a popular destination for travellers. While visitors should typically feel safe, you should always keep an eye out for potential threats and dangers. </span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1638" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1638" style="width: 698px">![koh samui sunset](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-samui-sunset-300x200-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1638">Koh Samui sunset</figcaption></figure>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Petty crime is one of the biggest problems the island faces, ranging from theft to tourist scams. Here are a few scams that you should look out for in particular:</span>

**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overpriced Taxis –</span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> while most of the Taxies have meters, few ever actually use them. Instead, drivers will try and negotiate a fixed price, usually costing you more. If you are taking a taxi, confirm that you want to use the meter before getting in. If you are paying a fixed price, try to have an idea of what it should cost beforehand.</span>

**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jet Skis / Motorbike Scam –</span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a common scam to look out for on Koh Samui is the Jet Ski or motorbike scam (or really anything that you’re hiring). The way this works is by you hiring something of value, and then on return, the vendor claims it has been damaged (usually resulting in you paying an extortionate amount of money for the damages). The way to avoid this is by always taking photos of what you are hiring beforehand.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1635" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1635" style="width: 697px">![koh samui jet ski scam](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-samui-jet-ski-scam-300x200-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1635">Jet skiing in Koh Samui</figcaption></figure>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Combine these scams with theft, drunken tourists, and road accidents, and you can see why safety in Koh Samui may be a worry. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, even after taking into consideration all the different threats in Koh Samui, the chances of you experiencing any of these situations are incredibly rare – and that is why we no issue in declaring that Koh Samui is very safe.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is Koh Samui Safe? (The Facts)</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Koh Samui is </span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">undoubtedly safe to travel.</span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The island welcomes over 2.5 million tourists a year – and this number is rising.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The most significant threat in Koh Samui is road traffic accidents. There is reported to be over 30 road traffic deaths per month on the island, mainly consisting of motorbike accidents.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1644" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1644" style="width: 698px">![koh samui roads](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-samui-roads-300x198-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1644">The roads in Koh Samui</figcaption></figure>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most victims are found not only not to be wearing a helmet, but also not wearing adequate protection in terms of clothing. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The mixture of drunk-tourists, lack of motorbike skills, unlicensed drivers, and not to mention the young chaps that drive like maniacs, make Koh Samui a dangerous place when it comes to road safety.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">It’s safe to visit Koh Samui in 2019, but apply common sense when visiting the island. </span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Koh Samui Travel Insurance</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enjoy your time in Koh Samui, but always ensure you get travel insurance! No matter if you’re only going for a short period, you should always take out travel cover. Take our word: travel insurance can save you thousands of pounds – so make sure to purchase it before you leave.</span>
