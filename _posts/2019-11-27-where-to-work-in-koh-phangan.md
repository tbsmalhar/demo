<div>The island of Koh Phangan, in the Gulf of Thailand, is a digital nomad’s paradise. If you have ever dreamt about having the freedom to work from a small utopia island, then welcome to Koh Phangan.

In reality, the beach isn’t always the most practical place to work, but that dream of working from anywhere in the world is possible. And we can help you find the best places to work in Koh Phangan.

There are many clean and contemporary workspaces situated around the island. We have compiled a list of some of the best digital nomad hotspots on where to work in Koh Phangan.

## Dots Cafe

![dots cafe koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19145764_1860072710981228_4849697772502309647_n-2-300x169-1.jpg)

Over the years, [Dot’s Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/dotscoffeshop/) has developed into the perfect haven for digital nomads living on the island. The cafe has an abundance of natural light and different seating options to fit all needs.

You can utilise the uber-fast wifi while sipping on a delicious latte to fuel your work. The cafe provides plenty of plug sockets, so you don’t need to fear your laptop dying mid-sentence. The room is also air-conditioned, which of course is paramount when working in a tropical country.

**The Menu (Our Take)**

Dots offer a wide selection of delicious coffees, mouth-watering desserts, and heavenly milkshakes. Dots can make your coffee with any milk of choice: almond, soy or coconut. The prices are reasonable, and you can expect to pay around 100 baht for a coffee.

![dots coffee koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/where-to-work-in-koh-phangan-1-300x200-1.jpg)

After 17:00 the food is discounted, which is an excellent incentive for those late-night nomads.

**The Work Environment**

The majority of customers at Dot’s Cafe are also [digital nomads](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/digital-nomad-workplaces-in-koh-phangan/ "digital nomad workplaces in koh phangan"), creating the perfect environment to concentrate. Overall, we were delighted with our experience of working in Dot’s Cafe. Our only criticism would be the breakfast menu, which severely lacks options (unless of course, you want a Cake for breakfast!).

**Opening Hours:** 8:00 – 21:00 every day. Try to avoid peak times as the cafe gets very busy.

**Address:** 44/139 Moo 1, Ko Pha-ngan Sub-district, Ko Pha-ngan District, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand

## Doppio Cafe

Sat on the corner of one of the islands main roads, Doppio Cafe is tough to miss. Inside the premise, there is air-conditioning and a varied selection of tables and sofas for your comfort.

**The Menu (Our Take)**

The cafe has a menu serving breakfast, lunch, and many sweet and savoury treats. They sell their own branded iced coffees, too, which we thought was cool. Also, it is one of the only places we have been with a large selection of European teas (pure green tea, peppermint, earl grey, breakfast tea, chamomile, etc.).

We also tried the roasted veggie sandwich with chips: the chips were mediocre, but the sub was heavenly.

**The Work Environment**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overall, we are pleased with our experience working inside Doppio Cafe. The cafe isn’t as big as Dot’s, so there are limited plug sockets and space. The free wifi is very reliable and fast, and the service was always excellent. </span>

**Address:** Ko Pha-ngan Sub-district, Ko Pha-ngan District, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand

**Opening Hours:** 8:30 – 20:00, every day.

## Bubba’s Cafe

Bubba’s Cafe (formally known as Bubba’s Roastery) is a clean, friendly oasis of artisan food heaven.

![bubbas cafe koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bubbas-02-300x200-1.jpg)

**The Menu (Our Take)**

Bubba’s sells a large selection of delicious breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. From truffled Avocado to Pancakes galore, there are many different menu items which you can choose. Vegetarian, vegan and healthy eating options are also available to enjoy.

For the quality of food, we also found the prices very reasonable here.

**The Work Environment**

Generally, we had an enjoyable experience working in Bubba’s cafe. The cafe can sometimes get busy and noisy, which you can expect from such a thriving cafe.

**Address:** Ko Pha-ngan Sub-district, Ko Pha-ngan District, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand

**Opening Hours:** 7:00- 21:00, every day.

## Beach Hub Coworking Space

![beach hub koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-1537674393-300x200-1.jpg)

The Beach Hub is a unique space designed solely for [digital nomads](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/koh-phangan-digital-nomads/ "Koh Phangan digital nomads") and ex-pats. You can pay for a daily, weekly or monthly pass, and the membership comes in a variety of levels. We paid for a ‘Hot Desk’, which is a dedicated desk and office which comes in a selection of sizes.

Beach Hub is entirely equipt with the usual amenities such as wifi, printers, and photocopiers. Inclusive with the membership is access to unlimited coffee and tea to help you refuel. We can’t comment on the food as we didn’t eat here, but we’ve not heard anything negative.

**The Work Environment**

![Koh Phangan beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/beach-2165623_1280-300x169-1.jpg)

[Beach Hub](https://www.coworker.com/thailand/koh-phangan/beachub) is primarily an office on the beach, making it the idyllic place for any digital nomad. The single factor that lets this [coworking space](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/cowork-spaces-koh-phangan/ "cowork spaces koh phangan") down points towards poor management. We’ve heard numerous complaints and negative reviews during our time at Beach Hub, which is a shame for a workplace with so much potential.

**<span class="w8qArf">Address: </span>**<span class="LrzXr">Moo 8 Koh Phangan, Thailand, Koh Phangan, Srithanu, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand</span>

**Opening Hours:** 24 Hours. 7 Days.

And that concludes our list of the best places to work in Koh Phangan. If you have any suggestions of other workspaces that should be on the list, please feel free to leave a comment below. Happy working.
