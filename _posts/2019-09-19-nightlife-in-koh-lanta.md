Besides the nightlife, Koh Lanta offers a wide range of activities to enjoy during your trip. The laid-back vibes, empty beach stretches, delicious food, and incredible sunsets.

There are plenty of things to see and do in Koh Lanta for budgets of all sizes. Below we are going to list some of our favourite activities on Koh Lanta besides partying:

### Diving in Koh Lanta

![koh lanta diving](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-lanta-diving-300x157-1.jpg)

Although diving in Koh Lanta isn’t as popular as diving in [Koh Phi Phi](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/koh-phi-phi-nightlife/) or [Koh Tao](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/is-koh-tao-safe/), the island still offers some of the best dive sites in all of Thailand.

Immerse yourself in an abundance of marine life, coral reefs, and even the chance of sighting a Manta Ray or Whale Shark.

There’s a variety of dive sites to choose from, catering for all levels of experience. If you’ve never gone scuba diving before, Koh Lanta is the perfect place to learn.

### Lanta Animal Welfare

![koh lanta animal welfare](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-lanta-animal-welfare-300x200-1.jpg)

Visiting Lanta Animal Welfare is certainly a very emotional experience. The work that these guys/girls do is nothing short of incredible! Not only do they look after the cats and dogs at their shelter, they also do a lot of work in educating people on the island about caring for animals.

The shelter is home to around 30 dogs and 60 cats. Through medical care, feeding, love, and rehoming, these animals can go onto live a long and healthy life.

The centre is always looking for volunteers to come and help at the shelter. Volunteer placements can be both short or long term, which you can find more details on their [official website.](https://lantaanimalwelfare.com/)

### Visit Koh Lanta Lighthouse

![koh lanta lighthouse](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-lanta-lighthouse-300x200-1.jpg)

One of the most iconic attractions in Koh Lanta is the Koh Lanta Lighthouse, located in the South in Koh Lanta National Park. Ticket prices are 200 baht for adults and 100 baht for children.

The lighthouse is surrounded by a long stretch of beach, a spectacular place to get that picture-perfect shot. There are a series of paths at the National Park which take you up the hillside, providing some great viewpoints of panoramic views of the park.

The lighthouse is pinpointed at the very top of the cliff and usually takes about a 10-minute walk. From the top, you can witness the waves crashing against the rocks, along with an incredible view of the horizon.

### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stroll Around Lanta Old Town</span>

![lanta old town](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lanta-old-town-300x169-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Located on the east coast is a small village; Lanta Old Town. Old town is the new district capital and offers an interesting array of culture. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The old town is picturesque. Most of the homes are built from wood and overlook an amazing ocean view. The village is rich with history and culture. Historically, the town was created by sea gypsies, who still live in the village today.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">During your trip make sure to stop for some food as there are plenty of lovely restaurants to try.</span>

### Lounging around on a nearby beach

![koh lanta beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-lanta-beach-300x169-1.jpg)

Our all-time favourite activity: lounging around on one the empty nearby beaches. Koh Lanta is renown for its stunning, quiet, and picture-perfect beaches.

There are plenty of beaches to choose from: Long Beach, Secret Beach, Nui Beach, and Klong Khong Beach are amongst the most popular.

The best thing is that the beaches are always quiet, meaning you won’t have to share them with loads of other people.

Sometimes, we could all use a day off to do nothing but soak up the sun on a deserted and sandy beach.

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">How long should you spend in Koh Lanta?</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">How long you should spend in Koh Lanta is different for everyone, but we wouldn’t recommend staying here for any more than 5 days. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Five days will allow you plenty of time to visit the main hotspots, and also discover some of the lesser-known parts of the island.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can stay longer, but be prepared to spend a lot of time lounging around as a beach bum.</span>

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Best time to visit Koh Lanta</span>

**The best time to visit Koh Lanta is between January and April.**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Koh Lanta, the seasons are split into two halves. The </span>**<span data-preserver-spaces="true">rainy season, </span>**which is<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> between May and December, and the **dry season**, which is between January to April. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">June to October is considered one of the worst times to visit due to heavy rainfall and extreme weather conditions, resulting in most places being closed and travel to and from the island more difficult.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The </span>dry and hottest months are between January to April<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and is one of the best time to visit Ko Lanta.</span>
