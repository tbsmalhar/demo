<div>There are several choices available when you want to extend your Thai visa, and it all depends on the kind of visa that you hold. We are going to share the most common types of visas and the extension options possible.

If you are looking for a Bangkok visa extension, then this guide is here to assist.

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tourist Visa Exemption (Maximum 30 Days)</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you have not applied for a visa before entering Thailand, you can get a ‘tourist visa exemption’ on arrival to the country. This will allow you to enter Thailand under the visa exemption policy, and stay in the country for a maximum of 30 days.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">64 countries are eligible to enter Thailand under the visa exemption rule; please find a full list of countries </span>[<span data-preserver-spaces="true">here.</span>](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand/changes-visa-exempt.php)

### Extending Visa Exemption Bangkok

You can [extend a visa](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/how-to-extend-visa/ "how to extend visa") exemption for 30 days just once at the Bangkok immigration office (or any other Thai immigration office). If you leave Thailand and come back and get a new stamp, you can also extend that stamp for another 30 days.

[Extending a 30-day visa](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/bangkok-visa-extend/ "bangkok visa extend") exemption stamp is reasonably straightforward and will require the following:

- 1,900 Baht
- A passport that is valid for at least six months
- Completed extension form (you can get this at the immigration office)
- Photocopy of your passport
- One passport photo (3.5 cm x 4.5 cm)

Surprisingly, the process is very convenient, and you can get all of your photos/photocopies at the immigration office for a small fee of a few baht.

### Extending Tourist Visa Thailand

If you entered Thailand with a visa that you applied with before your trip, then the chances are you have a 60-day tourist visa.

If you hold a 60-day tourist visa, you can also extend this for 30 further days. Alternatively, if you possess a 30-day entry permit, you can extend it for up to seven days.

No matter if you have a 60-day tourist visa and you want to extend it for 30 days, or you hold a 30-day entry permit, and you’re planning to extend it for seven days, the process, requirements, and fees are still the same.

You will require the following:

- 1,900 Baht
- A passport that is valid for at least six months
- Completed extension form (you can get this at the immigration office)
- Photocopy of your passport
- One passport photo (3.5 cm x 4.5 cm)

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">How To Extend Your Thai Visa At Bangkok Immigration Office</span>

![extend visa thailand](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/passport-visa-thailand-300x200-1.jpg)

Bangkok Immigration Office opens at 8:30 am, it’s best to arrive early to avoid long wait times. Once you arrive, you will need to go to Immigration Division Room 1 and tell the staff at the counter you want to extend your visa. They will take a look at your passport and give you the appropriate forms.

Fill out the form, sign the appropriate documents, attach your passport photo, and make sure to have all of your photocopied documents to hand. Hand back your documents to the counter, and they will allow you to proceed to the next room.

Now you will need to queue up for a ticket number, and then wait by the counter mentioned on your ticket number.

When they call your number, you can proceed to the appropriate counter. The immigration officers will look at your application and may ask you a question or two. Finally, they will take your payment of 1,900 baht.

You will now have to wait again while they process your documents; this will take anywhere from five to fifteen minutes.

Once your number has finally recalled, you can collect your new extended visa and be on your merry way.

The entire process shouldn’t take any longer than one hour.

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">How To Get To Bangkok Immigration Office</span>

The Bangkok Immigration Office is located in a large modern building off Chaeng Watthana Road. It is only 7km away from Don Muang Airport, and certainly not the most convenient of places to reach.

The most obvious way of getting there is by Taxi; however, the most affordable is by taking the BTS Skytrain. You can catch a Skytrain to Mo Chit Station, and then get bus number #52 from in front of the park on the westernmost side of Phahon Yothin Road.

The bus only costs eight baht and drops you off directly outside of the government buildings. The Bangkok Immigration office is the furthest away of the three buildings.
