<div>**Hengistbury Head Beach** is a south-facing beach that separates Poole and [Christchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch,_Dorset) *bay*. The beach is a sand and pebbled beach, with striking clay and ironstone cliffs. Hengistbury head is both a scenic and historic attraction that incorporates various habitats and supports a huge selection of wildlife and plants.

The beach provides plenty of panoramic views – the Heathland, Christchurch Harbour, Bournemouth Bay and the Isle of Wight.

Over one million people set foot on [Hengistbury Head](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/category/hengistbury-head-beach/ "Hengistbury Head Beach") every year – which is a lot of footsteps on such a delicate landscape. But the combination of volunteers and rangers manage to provide a healthy balance between allowing public access and protecting the landscape and wildlife – making it an extremely special place.

## Hengistbury Head Walk

Many tourists who visit Hengistbury Head enjoy walking and roaming across its natural, yet accessible terrain. There are several country walks over the head, many of which were resurfaced recently to allow wheelchair access.
