## **1. Haad Yao Beach Koh Phangan**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Haad Yao Beach situates in the more hippier side of the island, surrounded by an abundance of yoga centres and vegan eateries. </span>[<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Haad Yao</span>](https://wikitravel.org/en/Haad_Yao)<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> beach has a deep sense of connection to nature and the environment, making it a trendy destination for backpackers.</span>

![haad yao beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/haad-yao-beach-300x169-1.jpg)

The beach is arguably one of Koh Phangan’s most spectacular beaches and can be found on the North West of the island. The beach is 1km in length and plenty of space wide, Haad Yao (meaning ‘long beach’ in Thai) is commonly referred to as the “perfect” beach.

A less commonly known fact is the coral reef which surrounds the island to the west and south and is a phenomenal area for snorkelling. The waters are crystal blue and contain a marvellous selection of marine life.

#### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">**Getting to the beach** </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The route to Haad Yao is straightforward as the roads are paved and signposted. Any form of transportation will take you there.</span>

- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scooter</span>
- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxi</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1495" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1495" style="width: 699px;">![Haad Yao views](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/koh-phangan-haad-yao-300x193-1.jpeg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1495">Haad Yao beach views</figcaption></figure>#### **Food and Drink**

There are plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from, but we have listed below a few of our personal favourite:

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*Vagga Bar –* A magical little restaurant, and one of our favourites on the entire island. The restaurant has an assortment of seating, with incent candles placed on each of the tables. The beanbags are particularly enjoyable to lounge on.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*Haad Yao Bayview Resort –* Attached to a large resort in Haad Yao, it’s hard to ignore the rather seemingly big restaurant. The establishment sits beside the rocky foundations on the beach, where you can enjoy anything from western cuisine to traditional Thai classics.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1497" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1497" style="width: 692px;">![Vagga Bar koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vagga-Bar-koh-phangan-300x206-1.jpeg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1497">Vagga Bar Koh Phangan</figcaption></figure>#### **Nearby Accommodation:**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*See Through Resort Haad Yao –* a 3-star resort, directly on the beautiful golden sands of Haad Yao beach. The resort occupies a large swimming pool that runs an impressive length of the building. The resort is primarily known for it’s the decorative and playful lit-up bar. There is a selection of rooms available, from bungalows to places in the main building.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*Haad Yao Bayview Resort –* a sizeable 3-star resort, perched on the island’s bay hillside. The resort has two swimming pools and a grand restaurant on the beach.</span>

## 2. Bottle Beach Koh Phangan**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you know anything about Koh Phangan, then you’ve probably heard of </span>[<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bottle Beach</span>](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/bottle-beach-koh-phangan/)<span data-preserver-spaces="true">. It’s easily one of the best beaches in Koh Phangan.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bottle Beach is a must-visit hideaway that boasts stunning views, a white sand beach, and crystal blue waters. If you’re seeking a place to escape, then look no further. Most of your time at Bottle Beach will be spent relaxing and unwinding, enjoying the breathtaking views and the sounds of the splashing waves. </span>

![bottle beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bottle-Beach-300x200-1.jpg)

#### **Getting to the beach:** 

- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxi – You can grab a taxi from anywhere on the island, to Chaloklum. From Chaloklum you will need to take a Longtail Boat.</span>
- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scooter- Although it is possible to access the beach by motorcycle, we highly discourage it as the roads are incredibly steep and unsurfaced.</span>
- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Longtail Boat – You can catch a boat from Chaloklum that will take you directly to the beach. A one-way boat fare will cost you between 100-150 baht.</span>

#### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">**Food and Drink**</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most of the local resorts have a restaurant included where you can grab a bite to eat. Both western and traditional Thai dishes are available. </span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1501" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1501" style="width: 705px;">![pad thai bottle beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pad-thai-bottle-beach-300x200-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1501">Delicious Pad Thai on Bottle Beach</figcaption></figure>#### **Nearby Accommodation**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Please find below a few of the best accommodation options on Bottle Beach:</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*Haad Khuad Resort –* An excellent 3-star resort that has an assortment of humble small huts situated directly on the sand. The cabins feature charming interior decor in the bedrooms and bathrooms and come in either one-story or two-story apartments.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*Smile Bungalow Bottle Beach –* Rated a well deserved three stars, each Bungalow comes complete with an ensuite bathroom, balcony and interior fan.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">*Bottle Beach 1 Resort –* This fashionable 3-star resort is composed of coloured bungalows, available with either air-con or fan fitted rooms. It also boasts a large open pool if you don’t fancy the salty seawater.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wherever you choose, we wouldn’t recommend staying on Bottle Beach any longer than 1-2 nights as there is little to do other than see the beach itself.</span>

#### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">**Location**</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Also known as Haad Khuat Beach, Bottle Beach sits on the Northwest tip of the island.</span>

## **3. Mae Haad Koh Phangan**

Mae Haad beach is a slightly more interesting beach due to the fact it’s connected to a national preserve and marine park named Koh Ma. You can access Koh Ma by walking along a narrow section of sand from Mae Haad during low tide. The beach is located at the North West of Koh Phangan, and is possibly one of the most popular beaches on the island due to its link to Koh Ma.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

![Haad-Mae-Haad](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Haad-Mae-Haad-300x169-1.jpg)

The beach is wide-spread and has various massage huts and resorts situated along the front of the beach. You will find beach swings, hammocks and the usual attractions you find on the beaches of Koh Phangan. The sand on Mae Haad typical for Phangan; fairly fine and soft, and extremely yellow.

## **4. Haad Yuan Beach Koh Phangan<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>**

Haad Yuan beach is arguably one of the most beautiful beaches in Koh Phangan. Here you will find the most amazingly perfect beach. Picture-postcard views, white sand, clear aqua-blue waters and wonderful panorama. If you like to relax and you’re looking for somewhere to unwind on Koh Phangan, we would definitely recommend looking for [accommodation here.](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1DCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaFCIAQGYAQm4AQfIAQ3YAQPoAQGIAgGoAgO4ApTJ_-YFwAIB&sid=0580f5f9a762b8788acc78778cafcae6&sb=1&src=index&src_elem=sb&error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Findex.en-gb.html%3Flabel%3Dgen173nr-1DCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaFCIAQGYAQm4AQfIAQ3YAQPoAQGIAgGoAgO4ApTJ_-YFwAIB%3Bsid%3D0580f5f9a762b8788acc78778cafcae6%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%26%3B&ss=Haad+Yuan&is_ski_area=0&ssne=Haad+Yuan&ssne_untouched=Haad+Yuan&dest_id=900050768&dest_type=city&checkin_year=2019&checkin_month=6&checkin_monthday=8&checkout_year=2019&checkout_month=6&checkout_monthday=9&group_adults=2&group_children=0&no_rooms=1&b_h4u_keep_filters=&from_sf=1)

The island is difficult to get to and only accessible via Taxi Boat, hence you will not find many visitors here. Taxi fares vary slightly depending on the season, but you can expect to pay anywhere between 200 and 300 baht one way. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

## **5. Secret Beach Koh Phangan**

Last on the list is Koh Phangan, Secret Beach. Although it’s called secret beach, it’s no longer really that secret since the growing number of tourists who visit here every year. This said, the beach is still very beautiful with soft white sand, shallow waters and magnificent sunsets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

![secret beach koh phangan](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koh-Phangan-Strand-09-300x169-1.jpg)

The only downsides to Secret beach is that there isn’t many shaded spots to hide from the sun and it can get extremely busy during tourist season. Still, this is one of our favourite beaches on Koh Phangan and definitely not a place to be missed!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

[Haad Khom Beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/haad-khom-beach-koh-phangan/) is by far our favourite beach on Koh Phangan. You won’t find much information about this beach online as the locals try to keep it a secret but, if you do visit, you will understand why this beach is such a hidden gem.

Irrefutably one of the best beaches we have visited in all of our travels. From the moment you step inside the bay, clear turquoise waters stand to greet you.

Boulders scatter across the beach and sea, sometimes remaining buried until a wave unearths them. Please step cautiously. Surprisingly, though, the rocks are ideal for lying on to fulfil all of your mermaid fantasies.

#### **Getting to the beach**

- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxi- You shouldn’t have any problems finding the beach if arriving in a Taxi, as most of the locals already know the beach. </span>
- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scooter – We always recommend travelling by bike as it’s easier to explore the beach and to venture off to nearby beaches afterwards. There is available parking at the beach resorts.</span>

#### **Food and Drink** 

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ocean View Resort occupies the main restaurant on the beach; they sell a variety of the usual beverages: shakes, juices, alcoholic drinks and fresh coconuts. The restaurant also has a food menu; however, we did feel it was a tad on the expensive side.</span>

#### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">**Accommodation**</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you would like to stay on the main beachfront, then you have three options to choose from:</span>

- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coconut Beach Bungalows</span>
- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coral Bay</span>
- <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ocean View Resort</span>

#### **Location**

Haad Khom is challenging to find due to the lack of signposts. The beach lives on the north face of the island.

## **<span data-preserver-spaces="true">7. Leela Beach</span>**

![leela beach](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/leela-beach-300x225-1.jpg)

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another one of the best beaches in Koh Phangan is Leela Beach. Not many people have heard of this beach, which adds to the magic of the quaint paradise. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike its neighbouring beach Haad Rin, Leela Beach remains somewhat lowkey and isolated. The beach stretches across 800m and boasts white sands, clear waters, and a calm atmosphere. There are palm trees dotted around the beach which are quite useful in providing shaded areas to escape the sun. </span>

#### **Accommodation**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">A day trip to Leela Beach can be nice, but what about staying there? There are three resorts to choose from if you want to stay on Leela Beach:</span>

Easily one of our favorite beaches in Koh Phangan is Haad Salad. Found on the northwestern side of the island, this slice of paradise is the perfect stop to relax and unwind.

Again, this beach is somewhat hidden and is the complete opposite of beaches like Haad Rin. The beach is what you would consider paradise: white sand beaches surrounded by green cliffs and swaying palm trees.

If you enjoy being underwater, then Haad Salad has some of the best snorkeling spots in Koh Phangan. Expect to find an array of colorful fish with excellent visibility.

#### **<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Food and Drink </span>**

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are a handful of restaurants in Haad Salad found directly on the beachfront such as Cookie’s Salad, My Way, and Jeng’s restaurant. Many kinds of food are available to suit all types of budgets. You can find pretty much any Thai dish, as well as a range of international favorites, including pizza and burgers. </span>

## **9. Chaloklum Beach**

Chaloklum Beach is roughly 2.5km long and resides on the northern side of the island. The area is predominantly a fishing village with a very sleepy and laid back vibe.

The beach is one of a kind and is amongst the most peaceful and quietest places in Koh Phangan.

#### **<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Food and Drink </span>**

There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of Chaloklum Beach. As you can expect with any fishing village, seafood is the typical dish of choice. Favorite restaurants include Aunjai Seafood, The Beach Cafe, and Texas Restaurant &amp; Bar.
