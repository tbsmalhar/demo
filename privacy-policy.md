Welcome to the Journeying the Globe website/blog which is located on [www.journeyingtheglobe.com](https://dev.journeyingtheglobe.com/) (“Site” or “Website”). Journeying the Globe respects your privacy and is committed to taking reasonable steps towards protecting your privacy online and managing your information responsibly, in order to best understand the services that are most useful to you.

Journeying the Globe takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you register for and view our daily email or visit our website. By using our website, you consent to our Privacy Policy and our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below. Please read this notice carefully.

**Personal Information** To receive our daily emails, we require your email address. In order to provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, geographical location, and telephone number. Journeyingtheglobe.com does not collect any other personally identifiable information that you do not expressly provide. However, we may use technologies such as cookies, log files, web beacons, pixel tags, IP addresses, device identification, analytics and social media widgets to gather information about you. We will never sell, rent, or share your personal information, including your email address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your permission. We may share your personal information for the purpose of delivering our email to you or as required by law.

The personal data that we collect about you will be transferred to, and stored by us, in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Countries outside the EEA may not offer the same level of data protection as countries within the EEA. When transferring data outside the EEA, we will:

1. Include the standard contractual data protection clauses approved by the European Commission for transferring personal data outside the EEA into our contracts with relevant third parties; or
2. Ensure that the country in which your personal data will be handled had been deemed “adequate” by the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR.

**Non-Personal Information** We may also request non-personally identifiable information, such as annual income, buying preferences or age, also known as demographic and profile data, though this information is optional. We may use this data to improve our daily email and site and/or tailor your experience, showing you or delivering to you by email content that we think might be of interest to you, and displaying content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising in our emails or on our site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

**Usage Information** In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, journeyingtheglobe.com may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers’ use of our daily email and site. This information is not personally identifiable and will only be used to find out how subscribers use our daily email, site and services. For example, this information will tell us how often a user opens the daily email, how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers come, and to what other sites subscribers go to. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently deliver your emails.

**Review &amp; Access** Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information.

**How To Unsubscribe** You can unsubscribe from receiving emails at any time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the footer of any of our emails. We, of course, do not want to see you go, but if for any reason you want to leave us and have trouble doing so, please email contact@dev.journeyingtheglobe.com.

**Choice/Opt-Out** If we ever send you information by email concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address by which you may request no future notices.

**Third Party Advertising** Some of the ads appearing in our email and on our website may be delivered to you by our advertising partner(s). Information about your visit to a partner site(s), such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

Occasionally, you’ll get an email marked “Dedicated” in the subject line and e-mail header. These emails are not necessarily reflective of the opinions of the editorial staff. They are content paid for by our sponsors. You can unsubscribe from receiving these emails, however, if you do so you will no longer receive unsponsored emails either. Please see “How To Unsubscribe” above.

**Tracking** Like most sites, journeyingtheglobe.com makes use of browser “cookies”. Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard disk by our server. They allow us to quickly recognise you and simplify your user experience. Journeyingtheglobe.com will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that is unrelated to our site or services.

**Third Party Cookies** In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third party advertisers may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser.

**Links To Other Sites** As part of the service, journeyingtheglobe.com will create links allowing you to access third party sites. journeyingtheglobe.com is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites’ individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.

**Security** All information described above is stored on restricted database servers.

**Modification To This Policy** Journeyingtheglobe.com may change this policy at our discretion, but we’ll post any changes here, so be sure to check back for future information.

**Contact Us** If you have further questions about this policy, our daily email or our site, please write to us on contact@dev.journeyingtheglobe.com.
